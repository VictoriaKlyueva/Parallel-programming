# Programming-paradigms
 Second laboratory works on the course programming paradigms

# Description:
## 2. Parallel programming, 1st part

This program reads an image from a file, then applies the following filters to the image:
- Gaussian blur
- Mosaic filter

For paralysis, the following are used:
- A simple sequential algorithm
- OpenMP
- Vectorization

The operating time for different technologies and image sizes is also measured. The results obtained are displayed on plots in file [plots.png](plots.png)
